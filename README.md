# Treasure Checklist (GEODE MOD)
ML5's first Geode mod. Still getting the hang on programming inside Geometry Dash.

## Options (Settings)
* **Show Miscellaneous Rewards**: Displays other rewards (like Colors and Death effects) of the treasure room chests. The option is  enabled by default.
* **Disable Checkmark**: Icons aren't greyed out and displayed without the checkmark. If you want to see all the designs. The option is disabled by default.
* **Group by Chests**: Tier II chest rewards are grouped instead of displaying separately. The option is disabled by default.

## Developer details
* The mod adds a button in the "Shards-menu" of the Icon Kit (GarageLayer).
* Most of the menus and buttons have their own ID, except the icon ones.
* Portions of the code are documented, but not all of it.
* Requires "Node-IDs" (v1.6.0 or above).

## To-do List
* Improve the code by optimizing or reducing code.
* Add more extra details to this mod.
* Verify if it's compatible in Mac.
