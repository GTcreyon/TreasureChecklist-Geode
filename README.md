# Treasure Checklist (GEODE MOD)
This is my first Geode Modm getting the hang on programming inside Geometry Dash.

## Options
* **Show Misc. Rewards**: Displays other rewards (like colors and death effects) you get in the Treasure Room. This option is enabled by default.
* **Group by Chests**: Tier II chest rewards are grouped instead of displaying separately. This option is enabled by default.
* **Disable Checkmark**: Icons aren't greyed out and displayed without the checkmark, if you want to see all the designs. This option is disabled by default.
* **Not in Garage**: Removes the button of the mod from the Garage layer (Icon kit) so you can only see it in the Treasure Room. This option is disabled by default.

## Developer details
* The mod only uses one resource which is a grey info button that only shows up in the Treasure Room.
* The mod adds a button in the "shards-menu" of the Icon Kit (GarageLayer) and a whole new menu in the Treasure Room (SecretRewardsLayer).
* Most of the buttons, menus and layers of the mod have an ID.
* Portions of the code are documented, but not all of it.
* Requires "Node-IDs" (v1.8.0 or above).

## To-do List
* Improve the code a bit more by optimizing.
* Look to make it compatible on MacOS.
* Add extra details to the mod.
